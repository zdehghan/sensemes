<title>Team's current thoughts on sensemes project</title>

# Arduino or not Arduino #

## Pros ##

- Get moving quickly and at least get familiar with electronics part of this project quickly and delaying
learning about firmware getting golang to compile on target MCU.

## Cons ##

- Wiring is written for non-programmers, no RTOS and simple gui for designing a program.
- Also we will get a quick headstart and sense of progress but most probably we need to start from scratch passed prototyping.we could start learning about basic electronics with Arduino.

# Candidate Microcontrollers #

* [ATtiny85 - 8bit Atmel](http://www.atmel.com/devices/attiny85.aspx?tab=tools) 8kb program bin size is a bit scary.
* [STM32 - 32bit ARM](http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/mmc/FM141/SC1169) this is the one we picked at my last company after Atmel reaching end of life. Wiring notes suggest that Arduino team are working on supporting this microcontroller.

# RTOS #

* [DuinOS based on FreeRTOS for Arduino compatible boards](https://code.google.com/p/duinos/)
* [FreeRTOS](http://www.freertos.org/)

# Bluetooth Stacks #

* [DotStack - small bluetooth stack for low cost and low power embedded devices](http://searanllc.com/)
