<title>Firmware package for XBee Pro</title>
<xmp theme="spacelab" style="display:none;">

This is the firmware package for a bunch of xbee pro radio, downloaded from [Digi](http://www.digi.com/support/productdetail?pid=4549&osvid=0&type=firmware).

You need to choose the <i>firmware upgrade from file</i> in x-ctu and point to this zip file for x-ctu to be able to read the modem configuration.

So this is not only needed to upgrade firmware, but also for the x-ctu to make sense of firmware settings and be able to set device roles (coordinator, route, etc.)
